## Features

+ User Auth - Users can signup, login, and logout of an account. Certain pages and features are only available for logged in users such as booking and hosting.
+ Google Places Autocomplete and Maps functionality built into searching and browsing. Recommended searches are prompted as users being their search. Once they have confirmed their search, they can view available listings in that search area on the map with map markers displaying the general location of the listing.
+ Image uploading - Users can upload images of their listings with preview during listing creation. Once creation is complete, images are then stored in AWS s3 and displayed on listings page.
